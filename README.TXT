TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a technical support system for customers of the 
DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.

43. The putIfAbsent method of HashMap only adds a key with a value if the key is not already in the map. If the key already exists, it does nothing and keeps the original value.

46. It's mostly accurate and complete but it's not always easy to read. The class and method summaries are useful. I didn't notice any errors but it's really detailed about how the code actually works.

47. In the source code I found examples of Javadoc key symbols like @param and @return. For example, in Responder.generateResponse the code uses @param words and @return. The tags influence the formatting by making a clear section in the generated documentation that lists what parameters the method takes and what it gives back which makes the docs easier to read.

48.
* @author – shows who wrote the class.
* @version – shows the version number.
* @see – makes a clickable link to another class or method.
* @deprecated – marks something as old and not recommended to use.
